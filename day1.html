    <h1>Day 1: Immersion Narrativd</h1>
    <p>Ma’am Liezel Maranan and Ma’am Emelyn Leanillo accompanied us to our immersion venue at the Junior High School Administration Office inside the Oriental Mindoro National High School campus. The first person we met was Ma’am Alma Vida, who introduced us to her coworkers: Sir Hernan, Ma’am Grace, and Ma’am Jenny.</p>
    <p>After our teachers left, Ma’am Alma assigned us to assist her coworkers. I was assigned to Sir Hernan, who tasked me with sorting and arranging the report cards of junior high students alphabetically and placing them in individual envelopes for each grade level. Once I finished, Sir Hernan gave me a list of items to retrieve from the supply office.</p>
    <p>Later, Ma’am Jenny instructed me to alphabetically list the students’ names in the record book. During lunch, she asked me to continue the task after our break. In the afternoon, I passed my work to Jessa and helped Ma’am Grace rewrite entries in the logbook. I completed my task as our work hours ended.</p>
