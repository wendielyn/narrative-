    <h1>Day 8: Immersion Narrative</h1>
    <p> First thing in the morning, I completed the remaining files from yesterday with Ashley’s help. Afterward, we retrieved the files for the year 2016–2017 and retyped them because they were accidentally deleted from the computer and USB of Ma’am Jen. I worked on one file, then Ma’am Jen assigned me to arrange the SLAN documents in alphabetical order. She also gave me documents with errors to return to their owners for revision. After visiting the AP and TLE departments, Ma’am Jen gave me another task to stamp dates on the documents she provided. I then resumed arranging the SLAN documents alphabetically until the afternoon, as more documents arrived. Ma’am Jen reviewed them for errors before handing them to me for double-checking and insertion into the files I had arranged earlier. Before leaving the office, Ma’am Grace assigned me a final task to deliver documents to the Principal’s Office for the principal’s signature.   </p>
