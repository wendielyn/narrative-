    <h1>Day 9: Immersion Narrative</h1>
    <p> Upon arriving at the office, I immediately worked on transferring the remaining six files to Excel. I completed two files and assigned the rest for others to finish. Shortly after, Ma’am Jen called me and handed over the documents I had arranged yesterday, along with a new batch of SLAN documents for double-checking and integrating with the previous ones. She also instructed me to go to the STE building to find Ma’am Giazel for her signature. Afterward, I continued arranging and organizing the SLAN documents until the afternoon. Later, Ma’am Grace assigned us to arrange red ribbon documents by year and place them in file holders. By the end of the day, I successfully completed the arrangement of the SLAN documents.   </p>
