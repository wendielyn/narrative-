    <h1>Day 6: Immersion Narrative</h1>
    <p> On January 20, 2025, Ma’am Jen tasked us with encoding the names of all completers from 2016–2017 into Excel, totaling 13 files. To complete the task efficiently, we took turns encoding and reading out names. I began and finished four files, followed by Ashley, who completed two files while I read the names for her. Jessa then encoded four files, with Ashley assisting her by reading the names. While they were working, Ma’am Jen asked me to borrow a screwdriver from the clinic to fix her office chair. Finally, I completed the remaining three files just in time to finish before leaving. This task occupied our entire day, and we successfully completed it as planned.  </p>
