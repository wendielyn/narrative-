    <h1>Day 10: Immersion Narrative</h1>
    <p> On our last day, I was tasked with double-checking and rearranging the SLAN forms of the junior high school teachers. During this time, I also completed other tasks, such as cutting a piece of paper and giving it to Ma’am Grace. I was asked to deliver documents to the principal’s office for signing and went to the Math Department to collect SLAN forms from the teachers there. I proceeded to Ma’am Gleazel for the signing of documents. After completing these tasks, I returned to arranging and double-checking the SLAN forms, ensuring there were no errors in the dates, names, and signatures. I also went to the Senior High Registrar to return documents sent by Ma’am Jen, delivered a document to the Filipino Department for revisions, and continued working on the SLAN forms. Later, I was tasked to fetch a box for Ma’am Jen from the STE Department and returned documents to the Accounting Office. The day ended with final arrangements and checks on the SLAN forms to ensure their accuracy.   </p>
