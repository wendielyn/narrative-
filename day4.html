    <h1>Day 4: Immersion Narrative</h1>
    <p> We started the day by cleaning the office before resuming our tasks. I continued encoding the names of undergraduate students in Excel, as I had not finished the day before. While working, Ma’am Jenny asked me to accompany Sir Francis to have documents signed at the STE, AP, and English departments. At the AP department, Ma’am Merlie gave me a document to return to Ma’am Jenny, who then gave me another document to deliver back to Ma’am Merlie. While there, I also delivered documents to the supply office for Ma’am Charmie. After completing these errands, I returned to encoding. Later, Ma’am Jenny asked me to join her in buying lunch. After returning to the office, I spent the rest of the afternoon completing the Excel task.   </p>
