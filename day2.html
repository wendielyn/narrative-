    <h1>Day 2: Immersion Narrative</h1>
    <p> We began the day by cleaning and organizing the office, sorting files and documents, and discarding outdated papers. Afterward, Ma’am Grace assigned me to prepare scratch paper. Later, Ma’am Alma asked me to clean her mini electric fan, and Ma’am Jenny assigned me to type the names of undergraduate students from four files into Excel in alphabetical order. I worked on this task throughout the day. After completing it, I took a brief rest. Ma’am Alma then tasked me to collect the names of immersion students assigned to her from another department, but I couldn’t gather them as they had already left. Ma’am Alma instructed me to try again the following morning.  </p>
