    <h1>Day 7: Immersion Narrative</h1>
    <p> Upon arriving at the office, Ma’am Jen asked me to copy the files we worked on yesterday and transfer them to a USB drive. Since I didn’t know how to do it, Ma’am Jen taught me. She then assigned us the same task as yesterday—encoding the names of all the graduated students—but for a different year, this time 2017–2018. We took turns typing as there were 11 files to complete. I typed first and finished three files with Ashley’s assistance. Then it was Jessa’s turn, whom I assisted by reading the names aloud. She completed two files with my help and another one with Ashley’s assistance. While Ashley and Jessa were busy, Ma’am Jen asked me to deliver documents to the TLE and MAPEH departments. Ma’am Grace also handed me papers to deliver to Ma’am Rona at the SHS Admin, ensuring she signed the logbook as proof of receipt. In the afternoon, Jessa completed two more files with our help, but we couldn’t finish everything as Sir Hernan used the computer. During that time, Ma’am Jen asked me to deliver additional papers to the library and hand them to Ma’am Charmie.  </p>
