    <h1>Day 5: Immersion Narrative</h1>
    <p> Since it was Friday and Ma’am Alma was on leave, there wasn’t much work to do in the office. We waited for tasks to be assigned, and Ma’am Jenny asked me to go to the Senior High School registrar to have documents signed, confirming receipt. I also photocopied a document Ma’am Jenny gave me, punched holes in it, and returned it to her. Later, we organized and stored newly delivered office supplies. In the afternoon, I delivered papers to the principal’s office for signing. My last task for the day was to photocopy a document given to me by Ma’am Grace using one ream of bond paper.   </p>
